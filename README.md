# Udacity-deep-learning-nano-degree
Udacity Deep Learning Nano degree course repository, including various projects such as 
 * Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
 * Dog-Breed Classifier
 * Generate TV Scripts
 * Generate Faces
 * Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model

## Project Descriptions
### Proejct 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
Build a neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day. 

### Proejct 2: Dog-Breed Classifier
Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), given a image of a dog, identify an estimate of the cannie's breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

### Proejct 3: Generate TV Scripts
Using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), generate a new 'fake' TV sciprts. 

### Proejct 4: Generate Faces
Using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), generate new 'fake' human faces.

### Proejct 5: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
Using Amazon's SageMaker, Lambda, and API Gateway, build and deploy a LSTM network which predicts the sentiment of a movie review. Also, create a simple web application that uses the deployed model.
